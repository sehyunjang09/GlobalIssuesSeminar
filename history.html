        <h2>Medieval Period</h2>
        <h3>500 CE ~ 1500 CE</h3>
        <p>The Medieval Period saw a wave of deforestation in Europe. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, a growing population, religious expansion, and the introduction of new agricultural technologies led to the clearing of massive tracts of forest for farmland. Forest loss was both a social and economic transformation: clearing provided peasants with land, while rulers used it to consolidate control. In contrast, Chinaâ€™s medieval forest history remains largely obscure, though evidence from the Northern Song dynasty suggests industrial use of timber caused localized devastation.</p>

        <h2>Early Mordern Period</h2>
        <h3>1500 CE ~ 1800 CE</h3>
        <p>The rise of colonial empires introduced deforestation on a global scale. European powers cleared vast forests in the Americas, Africa, and Asia to support plantations, mining, and commerce. Demand for ship timber by naval empires, especially Spain, Portugal, and Britain, was immense. Though some early forest management practices emerged, the net impact was ecological degradation and the displacement of indigenous ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Industrial Rev.</h2>
        <h3>1750 CE ~ 1900 CE</h3>
        <p>Industrialization radically increased deforestation. In Europe and North America, forests were cleared for railways, factories, urbanization, and mining. Wood and later coal fueled industrial growth, while mechanization allowed for faster land clearance. Though forestry science began taking root (e.g., sustainable yield forestry in Germany), the cumulative forest loss was vast, and land-use transformation intensified.</p>

        <h2>20th Century</h2>
        <p>The 20th century witnessed both unprecedented deforestation and early efforts at reforestation. Post-WWII agricultural expansion, especially in Latin America and Southeast Asia, led to tropical forest destruction. Global population growth, infrastructure development, and agribusiness further exacerbated forest loss. However, the period also saw the emergence of environmentalism, forest monitoring via satellites, and the beginnings of international conservation policies.</p>

        <h2>21th century</h2>
        <p>In the present era, deforestation remains a critical global concern, especially in biologically diverse areas like the Amazon, Indonesia, and Central Africa. Forests are still being cleared for beef, soy, palm oil, and illegal logging. Yet, awareness has grown: climate change and carbon emissions have made forest conservation a planetary priority. Programs like REDD+, satellite monitoring like Global Forest Watch, and large-scale reforestation represent a dual effort to preserve and restore forest cover, though challenges persist with enforcement and political will.</p>
